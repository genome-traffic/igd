**Paper ref - https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/27/356998**
<br/><br/> 
Model scripts are divided by figure, retaining the numbering system used in the manuscript (above).
<br/>
Model scripts are deposited here as Wolfram Mathematica notebook files. 
All IGD scripts are locus specific. 
<br/><br/>
Additional MATLAB scripts used to generate repetitive sections of the model scripts will be added in 'MATLAB Tools'
