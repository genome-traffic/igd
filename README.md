# Integral Gene Drive Models
**The paper can currently be found in Biology Open [here](http://bio.biologists.org/content/early/2018/11/21/bio.037762).**
<br/><br/> 
Model scripts are divided by figure, retaining the numbering system used in the manuscript (above).
<br/>
Model scripts are deposited here as Wolfram Mathematica notebook files. 
All IGD scripts are locus specific. 
<br/><br/>
Additional MATLAB scripts used to generate repetitive sections of the model scripts are located in 'MATLAB Tools'.
